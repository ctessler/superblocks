%outline of paper
%The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, background information on the SWAP scheduling architecture is discussed in %Section~\ref{sec:background}.  The high level job execution structure and associated timing terminology overview is provided in %Section~\ref{sec:system_model}.  The SWAP scheduling algorithm and the Java based scheduling simulator are detailed in %Section~\ref{sec:implementation}. SWAP performance evaluation results as compared to several well known job scheduling algorithms will be presented %in Section~\ref{sec:results}.  Next we present current research efforts and related in Section~\ref{sec:related}.  Finally we will offer relevant %conclusions along with proposed future work in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
